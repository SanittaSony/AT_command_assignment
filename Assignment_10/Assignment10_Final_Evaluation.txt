Assignment 10: Final Evaluation

Scenario Flow:
1. AT – Check basic modem connectivity
2. AT+CSQ – Check signal strength
3. AT+CMGF=1 – Set SMS mode to Text
4. AT+CMGS="<phone_number>" – Send SMS
5. AT+CMGR=1 – Read SMS from storage

1    | AT         | OK                   | OK                   | Success
2    | AT+CSQ     | +CSQ: ,              | +CSQ: 21,0           | Success
3    | AT+CMGF=1  | OK                   | OK                   | SMS Mode Set
4    | AT+CMGS="" | >                    | Message Sent + OK    | Include Ctrl+Z
5    | AT+CMGR=1  | +CMGR: "REC READ"... | Error                | Doesn't work as expected

Flow Diagram
AT → CSQ → CMGF=1 → CMGS="number" → CMGR=1
- All commands follow a linear logic flow simulating modem SMS lifecycle

Summary:
- This sequence successfully simulated an end-to-end SMS operation.
- No major errors were encountered.
- Ctrl+Z input for AT+CMGS must be timed carefully.
- Emulator successfully displayed sent and received messages.
